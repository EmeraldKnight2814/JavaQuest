# JavaQuest
The basic premise of the project goes as follows:
 "Your task will be to write a very simple role-playing game called JavaQuest! The implementation of this
game will mostly be up to you, as long as the minimum requirements are met and the gameplay is the
same as described/demonstrated"

I decided to go above and beyond the minimum requirements and created this game with a basic GUI, along with Music and Sound Effects

**GAME DESCRIPTION:**

This is a text based game where you will create a character who is one of 5 classes, those classes being:
  
  **"Knight"
  "Healer"
  "Thief"
  "Wizard"
  "Bard"**
  
  
Then once your character has been created you have 5 options:
 
 **"Move North"
  "Move South"
  "Move West"
  "Move East"
  "Curl up in a ball"**
  
  
From there the game will make a check to see what happens next. Occasionally, you can enter into Combat. In combat, you also have 5 options:
 
 **"Attack" (Damage varies between classes)
  "Special Move" (Move varies between classes)
  "Finishing Move" (Move varies between classes)
  "Use Healing Item"
  "Run"**
  
All of these are repeated until the user decides to quit.
